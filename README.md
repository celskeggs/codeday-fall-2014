===================

This repo contains a small text based multi player game client and server side designed during a 24 hour codeing event. There are sellectable characters and moves for each one that causes different types of dammage to the other characters. this can be run on anything that will execute python. the only modification that will be needed is the host ip address for connecting to other players.
